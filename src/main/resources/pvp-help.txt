# A sub-topic section uses 2 dashes and spaces. example: "- - Test - -"
# The first section is the starting section
# "-N" to create a new line break (can use -N 123 for any number of newlines)
# "-N ON" - to start not ignoring new line breaks (turn this off with "-N OFF")
## "-F 9BIU" F: font, 9=size (can have 1-9), B=Bold, I = italic, U = underline
## "-L http://www.passvaultplus.com" starts a link
## "-E" to end previous control
## "-E ALL" to end all controls
## A comment is only a comment if the first non-whitespace char in the line is "#"

What most describes how you want to do right now?
	- I want to get going quick and try it out
	- I have fairly sensitive data, I want it to be easy to access
	- I have very sensitive data and I want to make sure it is secure

- - - - I want to get going quick and try it out - - - -

In this case, you may want to to leave the encryption turned off. You can turn it on later at any time. This will allow
you to test out the features without having to remember a password.

- - - - I have fairly sensitive data, I want it to be easy to access - - - -

In that case you want to get a password that has a "good" amount of entropy.
You can use the save password option along with a PIN so that you don't need to
enter the entire password every time. It is very important that you don't forget your
password. Perhaps write it down and put it in a very secure place. Ideally, you would
just want to commit it to memory. If you forget your PIN, you can always use the password
to reset the PIN. The timeout is the time in minutes until you have to re-enter the PIN.
This is a way to lock out people if you are away from your computer. You data file will
be very secure if you upload it to the cloud or have it on physical backup disk. If your
computer was stolen or hard-drive copied, it would be possible to get access to you data,
but it would still have a good level of security even in that case.


- - - - I have very sensitive data and I want to make sure it is secure - - - -

In that case, you should check the "Encrypted" checkbox, and use a password that is 22 characters long.
In general 128 bit encryption is good enough. You can use the 256 bit encryption if you have very sensitive
data. This is the solution that has the tightest security and it would be very difficult for some else to get
access to your data even if your computer was stolen. You can use the same PIN as the password you used.

Right clicking in the records table area brings up some options to show additional fields, change the layout, and sort.
Right clicking in an text field editor allows you to generate passwords

- - - - Records - - - -

When first starting, the Records tab is shown. Is shows all the records you have saved. You can narrow the displayed records by typing text into the “Filter” field. It is not case sensitive and all fields will be searched. You can also limit to a certain type of record or to a certain category. Double-clicking on the list will open up the detailed editor for that record.

- - - - Dashboard - - - -
The dashboard provides summary about all the data. In the future, more things may be added here.

- - Upcoming Dates - -
The "Todo" data type has a date field, if it is in the past, or upcoming within the "Number of days shown", it will be included here.
The "Important Date" data type has a date field. The year of the date is ignored when determining if it should be included here.

- - - - Diagnostics - - - -
In general, you should ignore this area.
-N 2
One exception is if you want to recover a deleted or changed record. The previous databases will exist in the same
directory as the main data, with a date stamp. You can search those by selecting "SearchBackups". After you click
search, it will search all the old databases for that text and output the file name and ID or the records. You can
then use that to re-open the record. Select "OpenBackupRecord", enter the file it was found in, and then ":" and
then the ID of the record. You can then save the record if you want to add it back to the database.
-N 2
You can use "SetAllModDate" to set the modification date on every record in the database.
You can use "SetAllCreateDate" to set the creation date on every record in the database.
You can use "Exit" if you want to exit immediately without saving.
-N 2
If you are troubleshooting, this may provide some additional information. But in general, if you are that deep into troubleshooting, it may be best to contact the author, so the issue you are dealing with can be documented or fixed.

- - - - Schema Editor - - - -
This allows you to change existing datatypes or create new ones. To edit an existing type, choose it from the type menu and press "Edit". Press add field to add a new field. Check the delete field checkbox to remove one. It will be deleted when you press the "Save Changes" button. The values of the fields will be deleted also. The "to string (short)" must be one of the fields in the type. The value of "formatted" can be any text. Values from the type will be inserted into the string when the name is inside the square brackets. For example, if you have an address type with a "City" and "State" fields, and you set it to "[City] , [State]", and the address was for Chicago Illinois, the formatted sting would be "Chicago , Illinois". You can use "\n" to indicate a newline should be added. When deleting a type, all the records of that type will be deleted also.

Being a sociopath - see people as ways to get what you want, ways to more power.
If my goal is to have kids, I need to be with someone I don’t really love.
If I am with someone I love, I don’t have control. Its really hard to walk away, its really hard to accept it if they don’t want kids,
In my past, I did not walk away from people that I loved that did not love me back.
	I did not walk away from people that loved me that I did not love back.
	I did not walk away from people that I thought someday could have their shit together.
	    do the hard thing now and walk away. I hold on too hard. Some people don’t hold on hard enough.
Do the ends justify the means?
love - love : no one controls the other.
animals - you have complete control over them
