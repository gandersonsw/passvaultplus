# A single dash indicates a link. It must have a space after the dash. (use tabs to have a hierarchy)

PassVaultPlus is designed as a password a manager. But it can organize, secure and
backup any important or private data you want. For example, you may find it useful to store birthdays or
anniversary's as "Important Date"s. You may want to save "Address"s here so they are backed up and secure.
-N ON


To save a password:
1. Click on the new button. (or use control-n)
2. Select "Account" from the type menu.
3. Enter a Title and whatever other information you want to include.
4. Click "Save"

-N OFF
In the documentation the word "Record" is used to define the things you are creating. So an "Account" is a record. An "Address" is a record.
Its kind of like a little document. Each record has certain "fields" it has. For example, an "Account" record has a "Password" field,
and a "Username" field, and other fields. An "Address" record has other fields, like "First Name", "Phone Number".



- - - - Getting Started: Settings - - - -
If you are looking to just look around and try things out, you may want to leave encryption off for now.
You can turn it on at anytime later.

In the "Settings" panel
1. Check "Encrypted"
2. Enter a password. You want the password strength to be "Average" or preferably "Good".


- - I have fairly sensitive data, I want it to be easy to access - -

In that case you want to get a password that has a "good" amount of entropy.
You can use the save password option along with a PIN so that you don't need to
enter the entire password every time. It is very important that you don't forget your
password. Perhaps write it down and put it in a very secure place. Ideally, you would
just want to commit it to memory. If you forget your PIN, you can always use the password
to reset the PIN. The timeout is the time in minutes until you have to re-enter the PIN.
This is a way to lock out people if you are away from your computer. You data file will
be very secure if you upload it to the cloud or have it on physical backup disk. If your
computer was stolen or hard-drive copied, it would be possible to get access to you data,
but it would still have a good level of security even in that case.

- - I have very sensitive data, I want to make sure it is secure - -

In that case, you should check the "Encrypted" checkbox, and use a password that is 22 characters long.
In general 128 bit encryption is good enough. You can use the 256 bit encryption if you have very sensitive
data. This is the solution that has the tightest security and it would be very difficult for some else to get
access to your data even if your computer was stolen. You can use the same PIN as the password you used.

Right clicking in the records table area brings up some options to show additional fields, change the layout, and sort.
-N 2

Right clicking in an text field editor allows you to generate passwords

- - - - Records - - - -
When first starting, the Records tab is shown. Is shows all the records you have saved. You can narrow the displayed records by
typing text into the “Filter” field. It is not case sensitive and will match against any of the fields of the record.
When filtering by text, a rating may be shown in the first column. 5 is best - a word match in the title, 4 - match in title,
3 - match in any field, 2 - match in notes field or a long string typed field, 1 - match on an archived record.
You can also limit to a certain type of record or to a certain category. Double-clicking on the list will open up the detailed editor for that record.

- - Views - -
A vertical view is when there are two columns, the "Field" and "Value" columns. When displayed this way, when you click anywhere
in the row, you can use "Copy" to copy the value of the field.
-N 2

A horizontal view is when each record is displayed on one row, with a column for each value. When displayed this way,
when you click somewhere, the field that you clicked on is what will be copied (even the entire row is highlighted).
-N 2

Selecting view
-N
Right click in the record list to pop-up options to change the view (Vertical Table Layout).

- - Data - -
-N ON
The list behaves different if there are different data types displayed.

If all the records displayed are the same type:
1. Sorting by any field, not just he ones that are common to all types.
2. When the horizontal view is used, it will display all the fields.
-N OFF
- - Sorting - -
Right click in the record list to pop-up options to change the view (Sorting).

- - Other Fields - -
By default, these fields are not displayed: Creation Date, Modification Date, Type, Category, Notes.
These fields by be shown by selecting them from the pop-up menu.

- - - - Editing Records - - - -
In the record editor
panel, there are buttons on the left to copy the entire field. If it is a hidden field, it will still be copied. If a field
has values that are reused 3 or more times, a drop down menu will appear on the right of that field to auto-fill the value.
If the field is a secure field, its value will be shown as “******” and an unlock button will show up on the right that will
allow you to see the field and edit it. On the bottom there is a button to revert all the fields. A button to cancel -
closing the tab and disregarding any edits you made. And a save button to save all the values and close the tab. The first time
you save a record, the creation date will be set. Whenever you edit a record and save it, the modification date will be updated.

- - - - Dashboard - - - -
The dashboard provides summary about all the data. In the future, more things may be added here.

- - Upcoming Dates - -
The "Todo" data type has a date field, if it is in the past, or upcoming within the "Number of days shown", it will be included here.
The "Important Date" data type has a date field. The year of the date is ignored when determining if it should be included here.

- - - - Diagnostics - - - -
In general, you should ignore this area.
-N 2
One exception is if you want to recover a deleted or changed record. The previous databases will exist in the same
directory as the main data, with a date stamp. You can search those by selecting "SearchBackups". After you click
search, it will search all the old databases for that text and display the file name and ID or the records. You can
then use that to re-open the record. Select "OpenBackupRecord", enter the file it was found in, and then ":" and
then the ID of the record. You can then save the record if you want to add it back to the database.
-N 2
You can use "SetAllModDate" to set the modification date on every record in the database.
You can use "SetAllCreateDate" to set the creation date on every record in the database.
You can use "Exit" if you want to exit immediately without saving.
-N 2
If you are troubleshooting, this may provide some additional information. But in general, if you are that deep into troubleshooting, it may be best to contact the author, so the issue you are dealing with can be documented or fixed.

- - - - Schema Editor - - - -
This allows you to change existing datatypes or create new ones. To edit an existing type, choose it from the type menu and
press "Edit". Press add field to add a new field. Check the delete field checkbox to remove one. It will be deleted when
you press the "Save Changes" button. The values of the fields will be deleted also. The "to string (short)" must be one of
the fields in the type. The value of "formatted" can be any text. Values from the type will be inserted into the string
when the name is inside the square brackets. For example, if you have an address type with a "City" and "State" fields,
and you set it to "[City] , [State]", and the address was for Chicago Illinois, the formatted sting would be "Chicago ,
Illinois". You can use "\n" to indicate a newline should be added. When deleting a type, all the records of that
type will be deleted also.
